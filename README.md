Develop from original design. including home page, login and register.

In this version, all data is hard-code. 
Another repository, exactly same page, but developed using React, data is fetch from server and display on the page, users are able to have many intereactions on the page, including search products, add to chart, pay and check order. 

but the server is recently down...not able to display and use most functions. so please check this one for now.
sorry!
